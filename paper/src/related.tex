% cite does-ct-break-the-web somewhere as motivation of TB's SCT CT policy
\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related}
Google's Chrome and Apple's Safari enforce CT by mandating that every TLS
certificate must be accompanied by two independent
SCTs~\cite{chrome-policy,safari-policy}.  We proposed that Tor Browser should
follow suit, but, unlike any other web browser that enforces CT, CTor provides
\emph{concrete next steps} that relax the centralized trust which is otherwise
and evidently misplaced in CT logs~\cite{%
	izenpe-disqualified,%
	venafi-disqualified,%
	gdca1-omission,%
	digicert-log-compromised%
}.

% Privacy preserving inclusion proofs

Laurie proposed that inclusion proofs could be fetched over DNS to avoid
additional privacy leaks, i.e., a user's browsing patterns are already exposed
to the DNS resolver but not the logs in the CT landscape~\cite{ct-over-dns}.
CT/bis provides the option of serving stapled inclusion proofs as part of the
TLS handshake in an extension, an OCSP response, or the certificate
itself~\cite{ct/bis}.
Lueks and Goldberg proposed that a separate database of inclusion proofs could
be maintained that supports information-theoretic PIR~\cite{lueks-and-goldberg}.
Kales~\emph{et~al.} improved scalability by reducing the size of each entry
in the PIR database at the cost of transforming logs into multi-tier Merkle
trees, and additionally, showed how the upper tier could be expressed as
a two-server computational PIR database to ensure that any inclusion proof can
be computed privately on-the-fly~\cite{kales}.
Nordberg~\emph{et~al.} avoid inclusion proof fetching by hanging on to presented
SFOs, handing them back to the same origin at a later time~\cite{nordberg}.
In contrast, CTor protects the user's privacy without any persited browser state
by submitting SFOs on independent Tor circuits to CTRs, which in turn add random
noise before there is any log interaction to speak of.  The use of CTRs
enable caching similar to CT-over-DNS, but it does not put the logs in the dark
like PIR could.
