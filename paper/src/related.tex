% cite does-ct-break-the-web somewhere as motivation of TB's SCT CT policy
\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related}
Google's Chrome and Apple's Safari enforce CT by mandating that every TLS
certificate must be accompanied by two independent
SCTs~\cite{chrome-policy,safari-policy}.  We proposed that Tor Browser should
follow suit, but, unlike any other web browser that enforces CT, CTor provides
\emph{concrete next steps} that relax the centralized trust which is otherwise
and evidently misplaced in CT logs~\cite{%
	izenpe-disqualified,%
	venafi-disqualified,%
	gdca1-omission,%
	digicert-log-compromised%
}.  Several proposals surfaced that aim to do better than today's CT
policies, targeting omissions and split-views.

% Privacy preserving inclusion proofs
%%%
Laurie proposed that inclusion proofs could be fetched over DNS to avoid
additional privacy leaks, i.e., a user's browsing patterns are already exposed
to the DNS resolver but not the logs in the CT landscape~\cite{ct-over-dns}.
CT/bis provides the option of serving stapled inclusion proofs as part of the
TLS handshake in an extension, an OCSP response, or the certificate
itself~\cite{ct/bis}.
Lueks and Goldberg proposed that a separate database of inclusion proofs could
be maintained that supports information-theoretic PIR~\cite{lueks-and-goldberg}.
Kales~\emph{et~al.} improved scalability by reducing the size of each entry
in the PIR database at the cost of transforming logs into multi-tier Merkle
trees, and additionally, showed how the upper tier could be expressed as
a two-server computational PIR database to ensure that any inclusion proof can
be computed privately on-the-fly~\cite{kales}.
Nordberg~\emph{et~al.} avoid inclusion proof fetching by hanging on to presented
SFOs, handing them back to the same origin at a later time~\cite{nordberg}.
In contrast, CTor protects the user's privacy without any persited browser state
by submitting SFOs on independent Tor circuits to CTRs, which in turn add random
noise before there is any log interaction to speak of.  The use of CTRs
enable caching similar to CT-over-DNS, but it does not put the logs in the dark
like PIR could.

% The same consistent view
%%%
Inclusion proofs are only meaningful if everyone observes the same consistent
STHs.
One option is to configure client software with a list of entities that they
should gossip with, e.g., CT monitors~\cite{chase}, or,
browser vendors could push a verified view~\cite{sth-push}.
Such trusted auditor relationships may work for some but not
others~\cite{nordberg}.
Chuat~\emph{et~al.} proposed that HTTPS clients and HTTPS servers could pool
STHs and consistency proofs which are gossiped on website visits~\cite{chuat}.
Nordberg~\emph{et~al.} suggested a similar variant, reducing the risk of user
tracking by pooling fewer and recent STHs~\cite{nordberg}.
Dahlberg~\emph{et~al.} noted that such privacy-insensitive STHs need not be
encrypted, which could enable network operators to use programmable data planes
to provide gossip as-a-service~\cite{dahlberg}.
Syta~\emph{et~al.} proposed an alternative to reactive gossip mechanisms by
showing how an STH can be cosigned efficiently by many independent
witnesses~\cite{syta}.
A scaled-down version of witness cosigning could be instantiated by
cross-logging STHs in other CT logs~\cite{minimal-gossip},
or, in other append-only ledgers~\cite{catena}.
CTor's extended design in Section~\ref{sec:auditor} ensures that anyone
connected to the Tor network is on the same view by making STHs public in the
Tor consensus.  In contrast, the base design is not about catching log
misbehavior, and the extended design in Section~\ref{sec:log} exposes logs
that misbehave \emph{without} fetching inclusion proofs.

% Other work that is closely related to our approach
%%%
Nordberg proposed that Tor clients could enforce public logging of consensus
documents and votes~\cite{consensus-transparency}.  Such an initiative is
mostly orthogonal to CTor, as it strenghtens the assumption of a secure Tor
consensus by enabling detection of compromised signing keys rather than
mis-issued TLS certificates.  Winter~\emph{et~al.} proposed that Tor Browser
could check self-signed TLS certificates for extact matches on independent Tor
circuits~\cite{spoiled-onions}.  Alicherry~\emph{et~al.} proposed that any web browser could
double-check TLS certificates on first encounter using alternative paths and
Tor, again, looking for certificate mismatches and generating warnings of
possible man-in-the-middle attacks~\cite{doublecheck}.  The submission phase in
CTor is similar to such double-checking, expect that there is no normal-case TLS
handshake blocking, browser warnings, or strict assumptions regarding the
attacker's location.
