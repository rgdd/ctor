\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
Metrics reported by Google and Mozilla reveal that encryption on the web
skyrocketed the past couple of years: at least 85\% of all web pages load using
Transport Layer Security (TLS) as part of
HTTPS~\cite{google-metrics,mozilla-metrics}. An HTTPS connection is initiated by
a TLS handshake where the client web browser requires that the web server
presents a valid certificate to authenticate the identity of the server (e.g.,
to make sure that the client who wants to visit \url{mozilla.org} really is
connecting to Mozilla, and not, say, Google). A certificate is considered valid
if it is digitally signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that the browser
trusts. Each CA is trusted to certify (sign) that specific cryptographic
key-material as part of a certificate belongs to a particular domain name.

The CA trust model suffers from \emph{weakest-link} security: web browsers trust
hundreds of CAs, and it is enough to compromise a single CA to get a certificate
mis-issued in the name of a target domain~\cite{ca-ecosystem,https-sok}.
Motivated by this issue manifested by prominent CA compromises---such as the
issuance of a fraudulent certificate for \url{google.com} by DigiNotar in
2011\footnote{\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20200521135444/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/08/earlier-this-year-an-iranian/}}---several
major browser vendors have mandated that certificates issued by CAs must be
included into trusted Certificate Transparency (CT) logs for browsers to trust
them~\cite{ct/a,ct,ct/bis}. The idea behind CT is that, by making all issued
certificates transparent, mis-issued certificates can be detected \emph{after}
issuance and appropriate actions taken to keep the wider web safe (e.g.,
revocation of certificates, suspected compromises investigated, or trust in
misbehaving CAs removed from browsers). Browsers that wish to benefit from CT
augment the validation done by the browser during the TLS handshake to also
require cryptographic proof from the server that the presented certificate has
been included into CT logs trusted by the browser. Notable browsers with
mandatory CT support by default are Google Chrome and Apple's Safari
\cite{chrome-policy,safari-policy}. Unfortunately, Mozilla's Firefox lacks
support but has a partial implementation.

Beyond security on the web, anonymous access to the web has also matured. In
particular, Tor with its Tor Browser (TB) today have millions of daily users
\cite{tor,mani}, and effort is ongoing into maturing the technology for wider
use\footnote{\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20200528174708/https://mozilla-research.forms.fm/mozilla-research-grants-2019h1/forms/6510}}.
The basis of TB is Firefox, where TB then enables anyone to browse the web
anonymously by relaying traffic between browser and web server through the Tor
network, consisting of thousands of voluntary-run relays across the globe. 

Just like attackers may be interested in breaking HTTPS, attackers are
interested in breaking the anonymity provided by Tor with the goal of
deanonymizing users. One common deanonymization technique, known to be used in
practice by, e.g., law enforcement, is to compromise TB instead of directly
circumventing the anonymity provided by the Tor
network\footnote{\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20200528175225/https://zerodium.com/tor.html}}.
Modern web browsers like TB (Firefox) are one of the most complex types of
software in wide use today. This complexity and wide use leads to security
vulnerabilities and incentives for exploitation. For example, the exploit
acquisition platform Zerodium offers up to \$100,000 for a zero-day exploit
against Firefox that leads to remote code execution and local privilege
escalation\footnote{\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20200521151311/https://zerodium.com/program.html}}
(i.e., full control of the browser for the attacker).

An attacker that wishes to use such an exploit to compromise and then ultimately
deanonymize a TB user has to deliver the exploit to TB\@. Since the web is
mostly encrypted today, this primarily has to happen over an HTTPS connection,
where the attacker controls the content returned by the web server. While there
are a number of possible ways for an attacker to accomplish this (e.g., by
compromising a web server that the target TB user connects to), one option is to
\emph{impersonate} a web server by acquiring a fraudulent certificate. Due to
the Tor network being run by volunteers, getting into a position for performing
such an attack is relatively straightforward (the attacker can volunteer to run
malicious relays~\cite{spoiled-onions}). The same is true for an attacker that
wishes to \emph{man-in-the-middle} connections made by TB users. In such a case,
a TB exploit may not even be needed to deanonymize the user; e.g., if the user
logs into an account at the service associated with its identity and that the
attacker can now observe.

\subsection{Introducing CTor}
In this paper, we propose an incremental design which we refer to as CTor. CTor
brings CT to Tor by modifying both how TB and relays in the Tor network work.
The goal is to make impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks on HTTPS
connections \emph{detectable after the fact} when they are carried out by a
powerful attacker that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item can acquire a forged certificate from a trusted CA,
	\item with the necessary cryptographic proofs from CT logs so that TB
	accepts the certificate as valid, and
	\item has the capability to fully gain control of TB shortly after the
	establishment of the HTTPS connection.
\end{itemize}

Our base CTor design uses the CT log ecosystem against the attacker to ensure a
non-zero (tweakable) probability of detection of the forged certificate. This is
done by probabilistically adding the certificate to \emph{other CT logs} than
those directly inferable as under attacker control (due to the accompanying
proofs). TB uses modified relays to cache and interact with CT logs for the sake
of privacy, ensuring that CT log operators (such as Google and Cloudflare) do
not get a real-time feed of all browsing activities from TB (beyond what their
privileged position on the Internet already provides them~\cite{TorDNS}). 
% FIXME: some other source would be good above, have to mention DNS to make
% current one make sense

Beyond the base CTor design we present two extensions. Both extensions have in
common that their goal is to make transparent the forged cryptographic proofs
from attacker-controlled CT logs used to get TB to accept malicious HTTPS
connections. Such a proof would likely immediately disqualify each offending CT
log and thus come and great cost to the attacker in terms of lost capability.
Even a small probability of detection may entail unacceptable risk at such a
high cost. Note that we have already observed several instances of CT logs that
misbehaved~\cite{izenpe-disqualified,venafi-disqualified,gdca1-omission}. Most
recently, a compromised CT log signing key was reported for the first
time~\cite{digicert-log-compromised}. 

The key change in the first extension is that relays now challenge CT logs to
cryptographically prove the correctness of their prior proofs presented to TB
instead of simply sharing the certificates (the subject of the proofs) with
other CT logs. In case an offending CT log fails to provide such a proof
in a timely manner,
the querying relay ensures that the proof arrives at a trusted auditor. While
this adds both more complexity and operational challenges to Tor (of both
auditors and storage at relays), it completely removes all trust in the CT
ecosystem. Another benefit is that, as a consequence of CTor's design, Tor would
provide a probabilistically-audited cryptographically-verifiable view of the
entire CT log ecosystem. This significantly addresses one of the main open
issues with the currently deployed CT ecosystem: the lack of a sufficiently
secure gossiping mechanism that makes it possible to place zero-trust in the log
operators.

The second extension involves only a minor tweak to the base CTor design.
Unfortunately, this tweak is primarily not to Tor but to the API of CT logs.
While similar changes have been discussed earlier in the context of gossiping in
CT, it is a significant deployment issue. The small tweak is that CT logs
provide an API for receiving cryptographic proofs made by other CT logs wrt
certificate inclusion. This would then mean that relays would add to
other CT logs proofs observed by TB clients in addition to the certificate.
This would also significantly reduce the trust assumptions the wider web has to
place on CT log operators, from close to full trust as-is today to only trusting
that some operators are honest.

\subsection{Contribution and Structure}
Section~\ref{sec:background} provides necessary background on CT and Tor. Our
threat model is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:adversary}, taking into
account the threat models of both Tor and CT\@.

Section~\ref{sec:base} presents the base design of CTor that enables TB to
probabilistically provide evidence to CT logs that it has been presented with a
fraudulent certificate. This greatly impacts risk-averse attackers, since part
of its fraudulent behavior has been made transparent through the CT ecosystem:
the issuing CA may get revoked from the trust store of browsers, the domain name
in question (as part of the certificate) is made public, and awareness of the
event may draw unwanted attention. Our security analysis, in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, shows that one of the best bets for an attacker may
be to attack the entire Tor network: an act that in itself may draw unwanted
attention.

Two extensions to the base CTor design are presented in
Sections~\ref{sec:auditor} and \ref{sec:log}. Both extensions aim to make
transparent the accompanying fraudulent proofs issued by CT logs to convince TB
to accept a fraudulent certificate. The deployment of either design would
greatly contribute to the open question of how to reduce trust in CT log operators
currently caused by the lack of an appropriate gossiping mechanism~\cite{FIXME}.
In particular, the auditor-based design (Section~\ref{sec:auditor}) would result
in a probabilistically-audited cryptographically-verifiable view of the entire
CT log ecosystem available from Tor's consensus. This view could be used as the
basis for trust by other browsers, greatly improving the security posture of the
entire web.

Section~\ref{sec:performance} estimates performance aspects of our designs,
including estimated circuit overhead and estimated load on the Tor network.
Privacy aspects of our design choices are covered in Section~\ref{sec:privacy},
with a focus on the essential role of the distributed nature of the Tor network
in both preserving privacy of Tor users as well as the overall security of our
proposed designs. In gist, a similar approach would not work without Tor, e.g.,
if integrated into Google Chrome. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:related} covers
related work and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this paper.
