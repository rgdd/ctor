\section{Privacy} \label{sec:privacy}
There is an inherent privacy problem in the setting due to how CT is designed
and deployed. A browser, like Tor Browser, that wishes to validate that SFOs presented to
it are \emph{consistent} and \emph{included} in CT logs must directly or
indirectly interact with CT logs wrt. its observed SFOs. Without protections
like Private Information Retrieval~\cite{PIR} that require server-side support
or introduction of additional parties and trust
assumptions~\cite{lueks-and-goldberg,kales}, exposing SFOs to any party risks
leaking (partial) information about the browsing activities of the user.

Given the constraints of the existing CT ecosystem, CTor is made
privacy-preserving thanks to the distributed nature of Tor with its anonymity
properties and high-uptime relays that make up the Tor network. First, all
communication between Tor Browser, CTRs, CT logs, and auditors are made over
full Tor-circuits. This is a significant privacy-gain, not available, e.g., to
browsers like Chrome that in their communications would reveal their public
IP-address (among a number of other potentially identifying metadata). Secondly,
the use of CTRs as intermediaries probabilistically delays the interaction with
the CT logs---making correlating Tor Browser user browsing with CT log
interaction harder for attackers---and safely maintains a dynamic cache of the
most commonly already verified SFOs. While browsers like Chrome could maintain a
cache, Tor Browser's security and privacy goals
(Section~\ref{sec:background:tor}) prohibit such shared (persisted) dynamic
state.

In terms of privacy, the main limitation of CTor is that CTor continuously leaks
to CT logs---and to a \emph{lesser extent} auditors (depending on design)--a
fraction of certificates of websites visited using Tor Browser to those that
operate CT logs. This provides to a CT log a partial list of websites visited
via the Tor network over a period of time (determined by
\texttt{ct-delay-dist}), together with some indication of distribution based on
the number of active CTRs. It does not, however, provide even pseudonymously any
information about which sites individual users visit, much less with which
patterns or timing. As such it leaks significantly less information than does
OCSP validation by Tor Browser or DNS resolution at exit-relays~\cite{TorDNS},
both of which indicate visit activity in real time to a small number of
entities.

Another significant limitation is that relays with the CTR flag learn real-time
browser behavior of Tor users. Relays without the \texttt{exit} flag primarily
only transport encrypted Tor-traffic between clients and other relays, never to
destinations. If such relays are given the CTR flag---as we stated in the full
design, see Section~\ref{sec:base:consensus}---then this might discourage some
from running Tor relays unless it is possible to opt out. Another option is to
give the CTR flag only to exit relays, but this \emph{might be} undesirable for
overall network performance despite the modest overhead of CTor
(Section~\ref{sec:performance}). Depending on the health of the network and the
exact incremental deployment of CTor, there are different trade-offs.
