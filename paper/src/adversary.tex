\section{Threat Model} \label{sec:adversary}
%
% Attacker capabilities
%
We consider an attacker that controls
	a CA,
	enough CT logs to pass Tor Browser's SCT-centric CT policy, 
	some Tor clients, and
	a moderate fraction of Tor relays.
For example, it is possible to
	issues certificates and SCTs,
	dishonor promises of public logging,
	present split-views at will,
	intercept and delay traffic from exit relays as well as controlled CT logs,
		and
	observe some Tor traffic.
A subset of CTor entities can be subject to temporary Denial-of-Service (DoS),
but not everyone at once and all the time.  In other words, we stay within the
threat model of Tor and Tor Browser~\cite{tor,tor-browser}.  It is further
assumed that the attacker knows all Tor relay configurations, e.g., available
memory and torlog's logging setup.

%
% Attacker goal and mindset
%
Given that we are in the business of enforcing CT, the attacker needs to hide
mis-issued TLS certificates and SCTs from entities that audit the CT landscape.
As described in Section~\ref{sec:background:ct}, this can either be achieved by
omission or inconsistency.  Our intended attacker is clearly powerful and may
successfully issue a certificate chain and associated SCTs without detection
some of the time, but, a CA caught in mis-issuance or a CT log that violated an
MMD promise will no longer be regarded as trusted.  Therefore, we assume a
\emph{risk-averse} attacker that above a relatively low probability of detection
would be deterred from engaging in such activities.

%
% - Our goal: detect TB HTTPS MitM
% - Why: it is a reasonable prerequisite to conduct attacks against TB users
%
We want to minimize the existence of successful man-in-the-middle attacks
against Tor Browser where it cannot be established if
and how they were carried out.  The property of \emph{detection} is inherited
from CT's threat model, which aims to remedy certificate mis-issuance
\emph{after the fact}; not prevent it~\cite{ct/a}.  We
focus on HTTPS traffic that Tor Browser generated because Tor is used to browse
the normal (encrypted) web~\cite{mani}.  Note that it is generally
\emph{difficult} to target a specific Tor Browser user due to Tor's anonymity,
circuit isolation, and HTTPS everywhere.  However, targeting a subset of all
users that visit a website is an eminent threat:
	simply intercept traffic from an exit relay~\cite{spoiled-onions}.
Once network traffic can be intercepted, it is trivial to serve an exploit to a
subset of Tor Browser users and much easier to target an identifiable user.
Such zero-day exploits are considered within our threat model because \emph{user
exploitation} is the primary reason to conduct an attack against Tor Browser.

%
% Defer introducing threats that follow from design details
%
We identify additional threats that follow from our adversary model and
design throughout the paper.  For example, the attacker may attempt to
\emph{flood} a Tor relay's submission endpoint to the extend that some
submission must be deleted, i.e., by posing as a Tor Browser user.  If enough
submissions are deleted, the attacker builds up confidence that stored evidence
of CA and CT log misbehavior will not be audited in phase~3
(Section~\ref{sec:todo}).
