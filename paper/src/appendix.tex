\section{Flushing a Single CTR} \label{app:flush}
Let $n$ be the number of SFOs that a CTR can store in its buffer.  The
probability to sample a target SFO is thus $\frac{1}{n}$, and the probability to
not sample a target SFO is $q = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$.  The probability to not sample
a target SFO after $k$ submissions is $q^k$.  Thus, the probability to sample
the relevant buffer index at least once is $p = 1 - q^k$.  Solving for $k$ we
get: $k = \frac{\log(1 - p)}{\log(q)}$.  Substituting $q$ for $1 - \frac{1}{n}$
yields Equation~\ref{eq:flush}, which was to be shown.
