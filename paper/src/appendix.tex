\section{Flushing a Single CTR} \label{app:flush}
Let $n$ be the number of SFOs that a CTR can store in its buffer.  The
probability to sample a target SFO is thus $\frac{1}{n}$, and the probability to
not sample a target SFO is $q = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$.  The probability to not sample
a target SFO after $k$ submissions is $q^k$.  Thus, the probability to sample
the relevant buffer index at least once is $p = 1 - q^k$.  Solving for $k$ we
get: $k = \frac{\log(1 - p)}{\log(q)}$.  Substituting $q$ for $1 - \frac{1}{n}$
yields Equation~\ref{eq:flush}, which was to be shown.

\section{Trusted Auditor} \label{app:auditor}
An trusted auditor is expected to accept SFOs at a dedicated endpoint,
endeavoring to validate the inclusion status of each SCT with regards to the
first STH in the Tor consensus that elapsed the log's MMD.  If a log appears to
function correctly except for some evidence that cannot be
resolved despite multiple attempts that span a given time period, it is
paramount that the auditor software alerts its operator who can investigate
the issue further before submitting a full report to the CT-policy mailing list.
Cases of misbehavior, in detail:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the log fails to provide a valid inclusion proof for an SCT with
		regards to the first applicable STH in the Tor consensus
		(certificate omission).
	\item If the log fails to provide a valid consistency proof between two
		STHs in the Tor consensus
		(split-view).
	\item If a published STH is future-dated or backdated more than an MMD
		(general log misbehavior).
	\item If a log ignores some CTRs (uptime misbehavior).
\end{itemize}

An unresponsive log can be suspected by observing the watchdog report frequency,
and possibly confirmed by querying the log in question from different vantage
points.  Among other extra-info metrics that go beyond received and deleted
SFO-bytes that the announced CT auditors should check, it could be valuable to
publish the extent to which CTR-to-log interactions fail.

While not within our threat model, we do encourage that the announced auditors
verify whether STHs in the Tor consensus are consistent with external views of
the CT landscape.  For example, operate an STH pollination
endpoint~\cite{nordberg} and fetch STHs actively from many diverse vantage
points using Tor, VPN services, DoH resolvers, and RIPE Atlas (to mention a few
options).  This goes back to the point of general ecosystem value.
