\section{Detailed Consensus Parameters} \label{app:consensus-params} 

Below, the value of an item is computed as the median of all votes.
\begin{description}
    \item[ct-submit-pr:] A floating-point in $[0,1]$ that determines Tor
        Browser's submission probability.  For example, $0$ disables submissions
        while $0.10$ means that every 10$^{\mathsf{th}}$ SFO is sent to a random
        CTR on average.
    \item[ct-large-sfo-size:] A natural number that determines how many
        wire-bytes a normal SFO should not exceed.  As outlined in
        Section~\ref{sec:base:phase1}, excessively large SFOs are subject to
        stricter verification criteria.
    \item[ct-log-timeout:] A natural number that determines how long a CTR waits
        before concluding that a CT log is unresponsive, e.g., 5~seconds. As
        outlined in Section~\ref{sec:base:phase3}, a timeout causes the watchdog
        to send an SFO to the auditor.
    \item[ct-delay-dist:] A distribution that determines how long a CTR should
        wait at minimum before auditing a submitted SFO.  As outlined in
        Section~\ref{sec:base:phase2}, random noise is added, e.g., on the order
        of minutes to an hour.
    \item[ct-backoff-dist:]
        A distribution that determines how long a CTR should wait between two
        auditing instances, e.g., a few minutes on average.  As outlined in
        Section~\ref{sec:base:phase3}, CTRs audit pending SFOs in batches at
        random time intervals to spread out log overhead.
    \item[ct-watchdog-timeout:] A natural number that determines how long time
    at most a watchdog waits before considering an SFO for reporting. Prevents
    the watchdog from having to wait for a circuit timeout caused by an
    unresponsive CTR. Should be set with \texttt{ct-backoff-dist} in mind.
    \item[ct-auditor-timeout] A natural number that determines how long time at
    most a watchdog waits for an auditor to acknowledge the submission of an SFO.
\end{description}

\section{Log Operators \& Trust Anchors} \label{app:ct-trust-anchors}
The standardized CT protocol suggests that a log's trust anchors should
``usefully be the union of root certificates trusted by major browser
vendors''~\cite{ct,ct/bis}.  Apple further claims that a log in their CT program
``must trust all root CA certificates included in Apple's trust
store''~\cite{apple-log-policy}.  This bodes well for the incremental CTor
designs:
	we assumed that the existence of independent log operators implies the
	ability to at least add certificate chains and possibly complete SFOs
	into logs that the attacker does not control.
Google's CT policy currently qualifies 31 logs that are hosted by
	Cloudflare,
	DigiCert,
	Google,
	Let's Encrypt, and
	Sectigo~\cite{google-log-policy}.
No log accepts all roots, but the overlap between root certificates that are
trusted by major browser vendors and CT logs increased over
time~\cite{ct-root-landscape}.  This trend would likely continue if there are
user agents that benefit from it, e.g., Tor Browser.  Despite relatively few
log operators and an incomplete root coverage, the basic and extended
cross-logging in CTor still provide significant value as is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Even if there are no independent logs available for a certificate
		issued by some CA, adding it again \emph{to the same logs} would come
		with practical security gains.  For example, if the attacker gained
		access to the secret signing keys but not the logs' infrastructures
		the mis-issued certificate trivially makes it into the public.  If the
		full SFO is added, the log operators could also notice that they were
		compromised.
	\item Most log operators only exclude a small fraction of widely accepted
		root certificates: 1--5\%~\cite{ct-root-landscape}.  This narrows down
		the possible CAs that the attacker must control by 1--2 orders of
		magnitude.  In other words, to be entirely sure that CTor would (re)add
		a mis-issued SFO to the attacker-controlled CT logs, this smaller group
		of CAs must issue the underlying certificate.  It is likely harder to
		take control of Let's Encrypt which some logs and operators exclude due
		to the sheer volume of issued certificates than, say, a smaller CA that
		law enforcement may coerce.
\end{itemize}

Browser-qualified or not, the availability of independent logs that accept the
commonly accepted root certificates provides significant ecosystem value.
Log misbehavior is mostly reported through the CT policy mailing list.  Thus, it
requires manual intervention.  Wide support of certificate chain and SCT
cross-logging allows anyone to \emph{casually} disclose suspected log
misbehavior on-the-fly.

\section{Flushing a Single CTR} \label{app:flush}
Let $n$ be the number of SFOs that a CTR can store in its buffer.  The
probability to sample a target SFO is thus $\frac{1}{n}$, and the probability to
not sample a target SFO is $q = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$.  The probability to not sample
a target SFO after $k$ submissions is $q^k$.  Thus, the probability to sample
the relevant buffer index at least once is $p = 1 - q^k$.  Solving for $k$ we
get: $k = \frac{\log(1 - p)}{\log(q)}$.  Substituting $q$ for $1 - \frac{1}{n}$
yields Equation~\ref{eq:flush}, which can be used to compute the number of
SFO submissions that the attacker needs to flush a buffer of $n>2$
entries with some probability~$p\in[0,1)$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:flush}
	k = \frac{\log(1-p)}{\log(1 - \frac{1}{n})}
\end{equation}

It is recommended that a non-exit relay should have at least 512MB of memory.
If the available bandwidth exceeds 40Mbps, it should have at least
1GB~\cite{relay-config}.  Given that these recommendations are lower bounds,
suppose the average memory available to store SFOs is 1GiB.
Section~\ref{sec:performance} further showed that the average SFO size is
roughly 6KiB.  This means that the buffer capacity is $n \gets 174763$ SFOs.
Plugging it into Equation~\ref{eq:flush} for $p \gets \frac{9}{10}$, the
attacker's flood must involve $k \gets 402406$ submissions.  In other words,
2.3GiB must be transmitted to flush a single CTR with 90\% success probability.

As a corner case and implementation detail it is important that Tor Browser and
CTRs \emph{reject} SFOs that are bogus in terms of size: it is a trivial DoS
vector to load data indefinitely.  If such a threshold is added the required
flushing bandwidth is still 2.3GiB (e.g., use 1MiB SFOs in the above
computations).  What can be said about bandwidth and potential adversarial
advantages is that a submitted SFO yields amplification:
	twofold for cross-logging, and
	slightly more for proof-fetching as the SFO is pushed up-front to a
		watchdog.
Note that such amplification is smaller than a typical website visit.
