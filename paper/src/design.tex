\section{Design}
Figure~\ref{fig:overview} provides an overview of our design idea.  The starting
point is that zero or more certificate chains and SCTs are presented
throughout a website visit (step~1).  We refer to these as SCT Feedback Objects
(SFOs)~\cite{nordberg}.  Tor Browser accepts an SFO if it adheres to an
SCT-centric CT policy similar to Chrome and Safari~%
\cite{chrome-policy,safari-policy}, but it may also be submitted to a CTR
in the background using a fresh independent circuit (step~2).  CTR flags are
assigned by Tor's directory authorities, and among other things, they also
determine Tor's view of the CT landscape by publishing STHs and announcing
third-party CT auditors in the Tor consensus.  CTRs store SFOs temporarily
before challenging the logs to prove inclusion with regards to Tor's published
STHs (step~3).  Should a log fail to provide a valid inclusion proof for an SFO
within a timely manner, it is reported to an auditor that investigates the issue
further (step~4).
